Certainly! Let's organize the plan for the caching system in your proxy server into three distinct categories:

### 1. Cache System Implementation

**Cache Interface and LRU Implementation:**
- **Cache Interface Design**: 
  - Define a `Cache` interface that includes methods like `get`, `put`, and `isExpired`.
- **LRU Cache Implementation**: 
  - Create a class `LRUCache` that implements the `Cache` interface.
  - Use data structures like `LinkedHashMap` for easy LRU implementation.
  - Synchronize access to the cache to ensure thread safety.

**Automatic Cleanup and Expiration Handling:**
- **Periodic Cleanup Task**: 
  - Implement a scheduled task or background thread to periodically clean up expired cache entries.
  - Consider using a time-based approach to remove entries beyond their freshness lifetime.
- **Cache Entry Expiration**: 
  - In the cache implementation, store metadata with each cache entry, including expiry time or max-age, to facilitate expiration checks.

### 2. Response Handling Related to Cache

**Parsing Response Headers for Cache Control:**
- **Extract Caching Directives**: 
  - Implement a method to parse response headers like `Cache-Control`, `Expires`, `ETag`, and `Last-Modified`.
  - Store extracted cache directives in a structured format (e.g., a `CachePolicy` object).

**Adding Relevant Headers in Proxy Responses in Responsibility Chain:**
- **Via Header**: 
  - Add a `Via` header to indicate the response has been proxied.
- **Age Header**: 
  - Calculate and add the `Age` header to indicate how long the response has been stored in the cache.
- **Passing Original Cache Headers**: 
  - Ensure that cache-related headers from the origin server (like `ETag`, `Last-Modified`) are preserved and forwarded to the client.

### 3. Request Handling and Cache Fetching

**Cache Check on Incoming GET Requests:**
- **Cache Lookup**: 
  - Before processing a GET request, check the cache for a stored response.
  - Use URL or a combination of URL and request headers as the cache key.

**Decorator for GetHandler with Caching Logic:**
- **Caching Decorator for GetHandler**: 
  - Implement a decorator for `GetHandler` that incorporates cache checks and serving cached responses.
  - This decorator should handle the decision-making process of fetching from cache vs. making a new request.

**Cache Validation and Serving Cached Content:**
- **Serving From Cache**: 
  - If a valid cached response is available (not expired), serve it directly without forwarding the request to the origin server.
- **Revalidation Logic**: 
  - If the cached response requires revalidation (e.g., `must-revalidate` directive), implement logic to validate with the origin server (using headers like `If-None-Match` for `ETag`).

**Asynchronous Cache Invalidation and Update:**
- **Handling Stale Data**: 
  - Asynchronously update or invalidate cache entries that are found to be stale during cache checks.
  - Implement logic to refresh the cache in the background when stale data is encountered.

### Conclusion

This plan structures the implementation of your caching system into distinct areas focusing on the cache's internal workings, response handling, and request processing. It provides a roadmap for developing a comprehensive caching mechanism in your proxy server, ensuring efficient data retrieval and adherence to HTTP caching protocols. Each part of the plan is designed to be modular, making the system flexible and maintainable.
